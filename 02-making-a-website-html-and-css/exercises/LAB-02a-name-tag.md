# Name Tag

Recreate a classic name tag in HTML

## Standard Setup Process

1. Create a repo called `lab-02a-name-tag` on Github
    - make sure to click add a `README.md`
1. Copy the URL of the new repo
1. From the command line (terminal) clone your repo:
    1. Check with `pwd` that you are in correct directory for labs
    1. `git clone <url>`
    1. **`cd` into your repo from the command line**
    1. Launch vscode with `code .`

## Process

1. Read through this entire lab document
1. **Have a plan.** 
    > Spend a few minutes planning your layout and styling approach. See considerations below
2. Create Semantic HTML
3. Add Layout CSS
4. Add Stylistic CSS

## Considerations

### HTML

- What is content versus styling?
- Are there sections? Is there a header? A footer? Or something else?
- Is the header text two headers? Or a single header with different styling?
- How would a screen reader interpret this?

### CSS

- Height and Width
- Margins and Padding
- Borders and Border Radius
- Background Color
- Text 
    - Color
    - Text Alignment
    - Text Decoration
- Font Family and Size

### Deploy to github pages

Put the URL to the github page in the repo's 'About' section.

## Points Break Down

Looking For | Points (10)
:--|--:
Deployed on GitHub pages, with link in the About section of the Github repo | 2
Use semantic HTML in your design | 2
Use `kabob-case` class names to organize your CSS | 2
Looks like a name tag with nice rounded edges, two red sections, etc | 4
Design and build a site to house your nametag with (at minimum) a header, a footer, a content area (containing your nametag) and a sidebar | +1
