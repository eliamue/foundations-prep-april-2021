Lab 04a: Calculator Refactor
===

- Turn your math operations into functions in a separate file to be imported
- Turn your click handlers into functions in a separate file to be imported
- For the math functions, add tests with at least 2 test cases per function to verify that the functions return what you _expect_ them to return
- Refactor names of things to clarify the intent and make your code generally more readable to other developers.

Here's a diagram of what the module architecture should look like:

## Points Break Down

Looking For | Points (10)
:--|--:
Variables with clear intent to make code more readable | 2
Refactored and imported math functions | 3
Tested math functions | 3
Refactored and imported click handler functions | 2
STRETCH: Use a dropdown to select which operation to exectue on click | +1
STRETCH: Write a single `handleClick` function which can work with any of the buttons (hint: use `e.target.value`) | +1
