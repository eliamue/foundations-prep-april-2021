Lab 03a: Interactive Name Tag
===

1) Update the project so that the user is able to change the name on the nametag with an input and a button.

1) STRETCH GOAL: Also update your nametag repo to add three buttons that change the background color of the tag to `pink`, `lightgreen`, or `lightblue` (or whatever colors you like) depending on the button you click.
